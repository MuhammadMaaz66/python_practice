# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my `python_practice` repository! This repo is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks created as part of my journey to become a professional Python developer. I push updates daily as I explore and practice Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and real-world use cases.

## 📅 Daily Progress

I am actively practicing and pushing new notebooks each day. You can find my daily commits under the `notebooks/` directory.

## 🧠 What You'll Find

- ✅ Python Basics: Syntax, variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- 🧮 Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- 🔁 Loops & Functions: Writing reusable and efficient code
- 🧩 Problem Solving: Exercises and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
- 📊 Data Handling: Basic usage of `pandas`, `numpy`, and data visualization with `matplotlib` (upcoming)
- ⚙️ Projects & Mini Scripts: Small real-world programs to test understanding

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming
- Learn problem-solving using Python
- Explore real-world applications: automation, data science, web development
- Transition into professional Python development

## 🛠️ Tools Used
